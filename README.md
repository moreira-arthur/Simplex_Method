# Simplex_Method
A Python implementation of the Simplex algorithm for solving linear programming problems, tailored to handle inequality constraints (A * x &lt;= b) and non-negative variable constraints (x >= 0). This project includes logging for detailed iteration tracking and compares custom results with those from SciPyâ€™s linprog function to validate accuracy.
